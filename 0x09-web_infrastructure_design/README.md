# 0x09-web_infrastructure_design
This project is the first milestone project in `Sysadmin` and `DevOps` track.
- It shows a diagram covering the `web stack` I built with the `Sysadmin`/`DevOPs`
track projects resulted from simple whiteoarding;
- It shows my understanding of how web applications are served;
- How infrastructures are scaled.

- It requires an understanding of what each component is doing;
- Understanding of system redundancy;
- Knowledge of the mentioned acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, QPS, to mention but few.
